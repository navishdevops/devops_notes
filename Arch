**“Our platform runs on Kubernetes (AKS) hosted on Azure virtual machines and is designed as a multi-environment, region-based architecture. Each environment—such as US, India, SG, and AUS—has its own public IP, Azure Load Balancer, and NGINX Ingress Controller installed via Helm.
Region-specific domains are mapped in DNS to the corresponding public IPs. Incoming traffic enters the cluster through the Ingress Controller, where TLS is terminated using Kubernetes secrets. The Ingress then performs host- and path-based routing to forward requests to internal ClusterIP services, which route traffic to the appropriate microservice pods—such as EMS, TMS, CNS, AMS, WFH, VMS, and Space Management—running within environment-specific namespaces.
Only the Ingress layer is publicly exposed, while all application services remain internal, ensuring secure, scalable, and isolated deployments across environments.”**


1️⃣ RESUME BULLETS (ATS-FRIENDLY + ARCHITECT LEVEL)
🔹 Core Architecture
Designed and operated a multi-region Kubernetes (AKS) platform on Azure VMs supporting environments such as US, India, SG, and AUS.
Implemented region-specific public IPs and Azure Load Balancers, each mapped via DNS to environment-specific domains.
Deployed NGINX Ingress Controllers using Helm per environment to handle secure external access.
🔹 Traffic & Security
Configured TLS termination at the Ingress layer using Kubernetes TLS secrets.
Implemented host- and path-based routing to expose multiple microservices through a single domain per environment.
Ensured only Ingress is publicly accessible, while all backend services remain internal using ClusterIP services.
🔹 Kubernetes & Microservices
Managed environment-level isolation using Kubernetes namespaces.
Deployed and maintained microservices including EMS, TMS, CNS, AMS, WFH, VMS, and Space Management.
Standardized ingress routing using environment-specific configuration files (e.g., azure-virtual.yaml).
🔹 Operations & Tooling
Used Helm for ingress lifecycle management (installations and upgrades).
Managed container image access using Docker registry secrets.
Worked closely with CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins) for automated deployments into AKS namespaces.
2️⃣ MANAGER / STAKEHOLDER EXPLANATION (NON-TECH FRIENDLY)
“We built the platform in a way that each region like US, India, or Australia operates independently while still following the same architecture. Each region has its own public entry point and security layer, so issues in one region do not affect others.
Traffic is securely routed through a gateway component that handles encryption and intelligently forwards requests to the correct backend services. Internally, services are isolated and not exposed to the internet, which improves both security and scalability.
This design allows us to scale regions independently, onboard new regions quickly, and maintain strong security boundaries.”
3️⃣ WHITEBOARD EXPLANATION SCRIPT (INTERVIEW-READY)
Use this step-by-step flow while drawing 👇
Step 1 – Start with the User
“A user accesses a region-specific domain like us.smartenspaces.com.”
Step 2 – DNS
“DNS resolves this domain to a region-specific public IP.”
Step 3 – Azure Load Balancer
“That IP belongs to an Azure Load Balancer created for the Ingress Controller.”
Step 4 – Ingress Controller
“Traffic enters Kubernetes through an NGINX Ingress Controller installed via Helm. TLS is terminated here.”
Step 5 – Routing
“Ingress uses host- and path-based routing to forward traffic.”
Step 6 – Internal Services
“Requests are routed to internal ClusterIP services, which forward traffic to pods.”
Step 7 – Pods
“Each pod runs a microservice like EMS, TMS, or Space Management.”
Final Line (Very Important)
“Only the Ingress is exposed externally; all services remain internal.”
4️⃣ “WHY THIS DESIGN?” (ARCHITECT JUSTIFICATION)
✅ Why separate public IPs per environment?
Fault isolation (US outage ≠ India outage)
Independent scaling
Easier compliance & audits
Clear ownership per region
✅ Why Ingress + ClusterIP?
Strong security (no public services)
Centralized TLS & routing
Kubernetes best practice
✅ Why Helm for Ingress?
Version-controlled deployments
Easy upgrades & rollback
Consistent environment setup
✅ Why namespaces?
Logical environment isolation
RBAC and access control
Resource quotas per environment
✅ Why TLS at Ingress?
Simplified certificate management
Reduced application complexity
Standardized HTTPS enforcement
5️⃣ ONE-PAGE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (MEMORIZE THIS)
“We implemented a multi-region Kubernetes architecture on Azure where each environment has its own public entry point and Ingress layer. Traffic is securely terminated and routed at the Ingress, while backend services remain internal and isolated using namespaces. This design ensures scalability, security, fault isolation, and operational consistency across environments.”
6️⃣ ONE-LINE POWER STATEMENT (MIC DROP 🎤)
“Ingress is the only door, namespaces are the walls, and services and pods are safely inside.”
